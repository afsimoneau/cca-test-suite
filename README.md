# cca-test-suite
Test suite and scripts for WPI students working on the ISU "CCA over a satellite"

Useage notes: This is to simplify the distribution, so mainly using master is fine unless you want to edit/improve a script that is already established

Tools to use:

UDPing
iperf3
tcpdump 
    use -s for snaplen
    use -w for write (need file name)
    use -i for interface (eno2)
    
screen (to pop out tcpdump into its own terminal)
tshark
sysctl
